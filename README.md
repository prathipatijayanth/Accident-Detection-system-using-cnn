# Accident-Detection-system-using-cnn

As the number of vehicle users continues to grow,
it is increasingly important to have effective systems in place for
identifying accidents in a timely manner. To address this problem,
we propose using a deep learning model that utilizes computer
vision and convolutional neural networks (CNN) to analyze image
frames from vehicles and identify crash events. Our model recieved an accuracy of 83%.The CNN model
processes the image frames and produces output indicating the
location, impact, and severity of any damage. This approach
has the potential to greatly improve the ability to quickly and
accurately identify accidents, potentially saving lives.
